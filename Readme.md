Supervisory control theory is brought up when early 80s', and is driven ever since. It is actually a powerful idea that modeling, analysis and control a mega system that includes tons of individual self-motion components. <br/>

Simply put, the supervisory control theory is driven by discrete events, and it collects as much as information in the individual plants such that a supervisor can supervise all plants in the way as the engineer desires. <br/>

A system includes 2 major things: plants that describe all components' behaviors and requirements that describe what the system may do. <br/>
